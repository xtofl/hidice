# HIDICE

Silly multiplayer game to prove that I can make one.

The goal is to have players throw two dice in turns, and select the one to put on the table.

When all players have played, the game decides whether the highest or the lowest die wins.

## Usage

1.  A player can enter the game area.  Let's call this player the Host.
2.  There they can start a game.  They'll receive a token they can distribute to their guests.
3.  Guest players receive the game token from the initial player
4.  Guest players enter the game area.
5.  Guest players join the game they have a token for.
6.  The host starts the game (no more players can join)
    1.  Now the game decides the order of actions
7.  Game is over; game token is invalidated.
